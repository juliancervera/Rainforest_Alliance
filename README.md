<h1>Cost and Revenue Calculation Tool for Agricultural Producers</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
The tool was developed as part of a summer internship for the Rainforest Alliance in Gautemala and Honduras. Created within the context of the Master of Development Practice program at the University of Minnesota, this tool is designed to assist agricultural producers in managing their expenses and revenues efficiently. The main Python file, RAMBUTANGO.py, is named after the rambután producers with whom we worked closely during our fieldwork.

<h2>Features:</h2>
<b>Comprehensive Ethnographically Validated System of Categories:</b>
<ul>
  <li>costs by productive activity</li>

  <li>fixed taxes</li>
  <li>certification costs</li>
  <li>export costs</li>
</ul>

<b>Enhanced Accessibility with Pop-up Buttons:</b> To improve accessibility and user-friendliness, the tool incorporates pop-up buttons with clarifications. These buttons provide users with on-the-spot explanations, helping them navigate the tool effortlessly and making the process of inputting data and performing calculations more intuitive.
